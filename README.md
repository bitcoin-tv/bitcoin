What is Bitcoin TV?
----------------

Bitcoin TV (Tupac Vision) is the pre-original Bitcoin. 2Pac makes references to the moon and its connection to Bitcoin (well hidden between the lines of his texts) everywhere in his art. For example, in the song `Killumati', 2Pac says "... moon ...". Or in `Tha' Lunatic`, where `Luna` refers to the moon, and 'tic' refers to the block difficulty adjustment interval.

Bitcoin TV (Tupac Vision) builds on Bitcoin core, and is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world, both into the future and into the past.
